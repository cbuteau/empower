The original mod was a Quake 3 mod I experimented with...

The concept was simple...

Kill people while in the air would increase your jump modifier.
Kill people while crouching ups your knockback modifier.
Kill people while running ups your speed modifier.

You became a GOD just by surviving.


## BabylonJS

When we investigated tech again...no game engine companies were building moddable games...

SO we are looking at BabylonJS

### Links

## Loading

Going to try and let go of requirejs and maybe do something new like systemjs

## Technical Plan

+ Load some scene
+ Load and move through scene
+ Load level detail of some sort.

## Status

 Have not touched...we should start from scratch.
 Lets check out PixiJS
