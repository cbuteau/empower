The original mod was a Quake 3 mod I experimented with...

The concept was simple...

Kill people while in the air would increase your jump modifier.
Kill people while crouching ups your knockback modifier.
Kill people while running ups your speed modifier.

You became a GOD just by surviving.

## Technical Plan

+ Load some scene

+ Load level detail of some sort.
